# Generalized Monty Hall Problem Simulation
 Generalized 'Monty Hall' problem simulation with graphing  and theortical value calculator for the switch strategy win percent

# Program Description: 
The user defines the parameters for the problem:

•	Number of Doors \
•	Number of Prizes \
•	Number of Doors to be opened by the host \
•	Number of Trials 

The classic parameters for the problem are (3 doors, one car and one door to be revealed).  \
The simulation then runs for (n) number of times, and each time picks a door then the host reveals a number of doors that don’t contain the prize. Then, the simulation tries out 3 strategies and records the results \
 •	 Stay at the chosen door \
 •	 Switch to an unopened door \
 •	 Random: make a random choice between all unopened doors 
 
The win percentage for each strategy vs number of trials is plotted in real time
